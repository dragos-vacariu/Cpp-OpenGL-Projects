Create a new project.
Go to the properties of your new project
Go to Properties -> C/C++ -> General -> Additional Dependecies -> and add there the "include" directories of your libraries
Go to Properties -> Linker -> General -> Additional Libraries -> and add there the "lib" directories of your libraries
Go to Properties -> Linker -> Input -> Additional Dependecies -> and add there the name of your "lib files" from the
"lib" directories added above
Go to your libraries bin directory and copy those dll files to your windows/system32 or whatever your .exe file from
your project will be generated.

Thats all!

The other way:
Go to: Microsoft Visual Studio installation directory/VC and copy the include directory content, into the include directory 
placed there.
-> and then copy also the lib directory content into the lib folder placed there.
-> and then copy the bin directory content into the bin folder placed there.

Finally after creating a project go to project Properties->Linker->Input-> Additional Dependencies -> and add there the
name of all the lib files that you just copied to lib folder.

That's all. (THE LAST STEPT NEEDS TO BE DONE FOR EACH PROJECT.)
