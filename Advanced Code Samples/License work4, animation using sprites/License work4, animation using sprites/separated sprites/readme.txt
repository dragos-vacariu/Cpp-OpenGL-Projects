unfinished Baroness sprite pack
original graphics by Capcom
editing by PrimeOp

This dead Work-In-Progress started as some spare sprite edits and turned into a project that died for
various reasons. Many of these sprites were going to be replaced and I'd slowly work on
some even after I officially cancelled the project. All of the sprites seen in the preview shots are here
along with many more that weren't shown. This even includes an edit for a possible funny win pose
and Midnight Bliss. G.I.JOE cartoon fans will recognize.

This WIP is unfinished and that means quite a few of the sprite look like complete crap. Also, some
of the colors are slightly off. You may have to do a bit of work to get a unified palette, but mostly with
the few skin colors. There is a folder with a few sprites from when I started to do more color
separation on the set, but it's only the standing anim and a kick. That version of the palette's main
colors is the best so I suggest you load one into a program that can create a palette, save that palette, and apply it to the other sprites.

The early sprites were made from XMvsSF Birdie (Sabretooth's lackey). The later sprites used combinations of Psylocke, Rogue and Rose. I used some cut-and-paste shifting to make her a little shorter. Many of the feet were originally from Street Fighter Alpha Rose sprites with adjustments to the feet. Some parts of these sprites (especially the hair) were done from scratch and don't have a base.

You don't have to ask to use this but I'd appreciate it if you credited me as PrimeOp if you use this
in a game project.
